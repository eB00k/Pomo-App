# Pomofocus App 🍅 ⏰
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

✨ Features
- Start/resume, pause, or restart timer
- Skip round to move on to the next session/break. If the timer is currently running, then a dialog pops up to confirm the user's decision. Skipping the round counts toward the number of pomodoros.
- Directly choose a pomodoro, short break, or long break round. If the timer is currently running, then a dialog pops up to confirm the user's decision. This action does not count toward the number of pomodoros.
- Alarm sound when timer is complete. When a round finishes, the next round is automatically displayed.
- Displays pomodoro counter and the current task to work on (defaults to first uncompleted task in list)
- Add a task, including its description and the estimated number of pomodoros needed to complete the task
- Displays list of tasks with the ability to delete, edit name, or edit number of pomodoros for a selected task.
- Indicate completion for a task (completed tasks are crossed off)
